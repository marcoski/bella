# Bella

Bella is a PHP project inspired by [Arel](http://github.com/rails/arel). Bella has the same internal structure as Arel and has a very similar syntax to it as well.

## Installation

1. Clone *https://github.com/tomkrush/bella*
2. Make sure bella is visible on server and target index.php for the unit tests.
3. So far I can confirm that Bella runs on at least PHP 5.2.13.
